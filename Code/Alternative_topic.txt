Our alternative Topic: 
Modeling a coral reef using 3D Cellular automata.

Application Domain: 
Computational Biology/ Environmental Sciences

Model to be used: 
3D Cellular Automata, based on previous work(github reference). Perculation is analzed based on Monte carlo methode.

Research question:
At what growth rate factor does  perculation occur?
Can we find a supercriticality signaling the "edge" of a coral reef.

real Data:
Density of Coral reef based on location
