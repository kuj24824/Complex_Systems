Complexity analysis of a City planning 2D Cellular Automata


-----------------------------------------
-------------DESCRIPTION-----------------
-----------------------------------------

The code we produced contains two models. One is supposed to represent 
the model used in the paper "Cellular automata and fractal urban form: 
a cellular modelling approach to the evolution of urban land-use
patterns" which tries to show how cities develope over time given
for possible states per location on a 2D grid. These 4 states are V
for Vacant, R for Residential, C for Commercial and I for Industrial.
This model recreates the plots seen in the paper, based on a fixed 
amount of cell-transitions per iteration. For complexity analysis on 
the otherwe chose to use a more probabilistic approach as comparison.
This entails creating cell transitions based on a probability that is
scaled by a downscaled version of the numbers given in the paper.

-------------GETTING STARTED-------------
-----------------------------------------

To run the code a jupyter notebook installation is required along with
a recent python release (eg. 3.9 as the time of writing). The python
packages are detailed in requirements.txt.
